Goal of the Project: Using Hadoop spark for storing, processing, analyzing and visualizing Community detection structure from real datasets
Datasets used: Facebook, google groups, twitter
Why not graph databases? Neo4J?
Why Hadoop Spark? 
Describe Snap dataset 
Algorithms used to detect community structures?
What are the different properies in data explored?
Hadoop provides all the steps but not Visualization
	- Histogram of node count in a community
	- Historgram of overlapping communities
	- Enter a node which then displays it community details (CommunityID, number of members, node attributes, neighbor communities) 
	
Advantages of the new Visualization tool compared to existing tools like in Neo4J?
	- Scalability
	- iteractive visualization tool as in Neo4j
	- community visualization tool
	- node-community information tool

Comparision of all the algorithms using the new toolset
Metrics used and runtime performance comparison 
Future work - 
a survey paper for all this
Difficulty in obtaining edge attributed data? 



NOTE: WE WILL NOT EXPLAIN ANY SNAP ALGORITHMS; IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE COURSE;

Presentation - Max 8 min
Demo - 8 Min
