Goal of the Project: Using Hadoop spark for storing, processing, analyzing and visualizing Community detection structure from real datasets
Datasets used: Facebook, google groups, twitter
Why not graph databases? Neo4J?
Why Hadoop Spark? 
Algorithms used to detect community structures?
What are the different properies in data explored?
Difficulty in obtaining edge attributed data? 
Hadoop provides all the steps but not Visualization
Advantes of the new Visualization tool compared to existing tools like in Neo4J?
Comparision of all the algorithms using the new toolset
Metrics used
Future work - a survey paper for all this
